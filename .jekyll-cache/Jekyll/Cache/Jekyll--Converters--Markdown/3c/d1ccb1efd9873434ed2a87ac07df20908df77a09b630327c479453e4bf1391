    <p>An end-to-end structured information extraction system from receipt and invoice images. As part of AI research and development team, I was responsible for continuous developement of the solution and timely integration with the production. I worked on GraphNN with textual, image, geometrical features of the words in the document to determine the tabular structure in the document. Trained and refined the model to achieve production level results. Improved the workflow by optimizing the pre/post-processing components.</p>

    <p>As a proof of concept, developed and deployed a bi-directional Mandarin-to-English active translation pipeline. The pipeline consisted of three components speech-to-text, neural machine translation and text-to-speech.  Worked with Mozilla’s DeepSpeech 2 for speech recognition, output of which was processed by Fairseq’s convolutional encoder + RNN decoder neural machine translation model and then converted back to audio using Tacotron 2 for speech synthesis.</p>

    <p>As a proof of concept, developed a abstractive summarization system to capture data from various sources and generate a brief and comprehensive summary. Worked on PreSumm, which uses a modified BERT encoder and a regular transformer decoder with different optimizers for efficient fine-tuning. While the encoder was able to capture the representations of salient contexts, the decoder lacked in generating cohesive text. Improved it by using GPT-2 as the decoder. The GPT-2 based decoder was fine-tuned to use BERT encoder representations to generate new text.</p>
