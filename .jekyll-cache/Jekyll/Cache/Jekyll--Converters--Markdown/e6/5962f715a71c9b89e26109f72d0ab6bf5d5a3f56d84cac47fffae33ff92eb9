I"<p>An end-to-end structured information extraction system from receipt and invoice images. As part of AI research and development team, I was responsible for continuous developement of the solution and timely integration with the production. I worked on GraphNN with textual, image, geometrical features of the words in the document to determine the tabular structure in the document. Trained and refined the model to achieve production level results. Improved the workflow by optimizing the pre/post-processing components.</p>
