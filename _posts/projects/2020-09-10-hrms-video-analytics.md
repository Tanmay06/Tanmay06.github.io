A system to monitor COVID violations and report it to the admin. Worked on NVIDIA Deepstream with TensorRT models to implement 40 simultaneous highly efficient stream processing pipelines. Also worked on extracting person's temperature information using thermal camera data. These solutions have been filed for patent and are waiting for approval.
